# rockpaperscissors
 
We use EMG data to detect muscle activation in the forearm and hand to classify which gesture a user makes, either rock, paper, or scissors. By understanding how EMG works through this application, we are able to understand how to use it to model other situations in the world.

In our repository, you will find the dataCollection code, which is how we gathered 600 data points of gesture data. Our OfflineAnalysis and Model and Features folders have several combinations of features and different data to optimize our machine learning model.
